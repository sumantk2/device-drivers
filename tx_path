BASIC WORKING CASE:

whenever we do ifconfig up / whenever we create a socket connection : 
network device driver will execute ndo_start_xmit function pointer (struct netdevice_ops)
ndo_start_xmit is ideally called by the network stack and sk_buff which is created
by network stack is passed as an argument to pci_map_single(). 
After that device will generate a transmission interrupt ( normally we check
the interrupt status register of PCI network card to get the status like TxOK /
TxErr etc. In this case we do pci_unmap_single() after the dma transfer is done
to the device and increment the count and no of bytes that has been transmitted
