BASIC RECEIVE PATH:

Well we get a packet received. Ideally we would like to hit the CPU .
But this would hog the CPU. So can be done ?

1) use a polling method.

How can this be achieved ?
- Before that we need to know about napi
  - napi_schedule() - whenever we get a interrupt, disable the Interrupt status 
    register Rx field and then enable it after napi_complete()  ??. A little later.
  - netif_napi_add(function pointer for rx poll)
  - napi_complete() - when we are done with polling mode. This changes the state field.

Check the interrupt status register if we have received any Rx. 
   - set the state and schedule it using napi_schedule(). Disable the Rx interupt.
     Now softirq will execute rx poll function ( passed as an arguement to netif_napi_add )
   - polling is done until maximum budget:16 ( it can exist before that as well). 
     Then we change the state field and enable the rx interrupt after napi_complete.
     Now we are in interrupt mode again !!!
